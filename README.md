# Report-Connect-4-code
Abstract: The aim is to explore the strategies to win a game of connect 4 using a combi-
nation of a statistical and a strategic approach. Using the work of the original
solvers, I show and explain how powerful it is playing first and in the middle
column, in comparison to the other columns. I also show how player 2 can still
win with a knowledge and skill advantage

Contains code adaptations and references bibliography for the code.

#Results for when player 1 places it in the middle and then player 2 places on top until it is full! (No draws analysed!)

Adpatiation list: 

Moves function was adjusted and the human input was removed and now both players inputs into the columns is random and i have changed the if statement for the human and made it so I can adjust to analyse different starting positions

In line 139 a "leaderboard" system was added to store who wins

Main program - removed human input.
